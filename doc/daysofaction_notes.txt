TODO list:
---
- admin user search broken
- receiving banished email trigger for 'after innocence' screening
- allow for setting calendar end time to never
- need to expire event show/search pages each night so that add a report link shows up and upcoming events is correct (cronjob)
- use other flashmaps (canada, world, etc.); parameter-ize setting this up from admin
- rsvp sweeper needs to delete event show page (stale attendee count)
- blog sweeper needs to delete event show page (stale host attachment)
momsrising:
- report-back reminder for host (using cron)
- auto-emails host reminder before/after event
- auto reminders for attendees (using cron)
- add validation errors to 'manage events'
--- lower priority ---
- track host contacting attendees

revent new-features/clean-up:
---
- admin: add Canada/USA as an option to calendar
- enable sass in themes directory (started this work vendor/plugins/multisite/tasks/themes.rake"
- dual authentication system (using ldap or openid)
- do localization
- allow attendees to specify number of guests
- move calendars/show to events/index; consolidate calendars/events helpers
- tie email triggers to hostforms (in addition to calendars & sites), since custom signup pages will need custom email triggers
- cap deploy updates: mkdir public/cache, chmod 777 public/cache, chmod 777 tmp/attachment_fu, clear memcache
- ability to add new admin user accounts from admin interface
- have featured_images go to site folders under featured_images folder
- find clean solution for 'all calendars'
- admin side: calendar radio-buttons misleading because users are per site (not calendar)
- admin interface redesign: considering having just users and calendars tab, and have calendars tab drill down into events
- MomsRising: CA House Parties - send excel spreadsheet of all new sign ups within last 24 hours.
- use same color for all required fields (state/date/time) 
- fix admin, active_scaffold validation sucks!
- signup form validation errors redirect to new page for partners
- change 'location' to 'address' since its mappable
- get caching working (turn off cron job that deletes page caches)
- active_scaffold: errors not displayed when validation fails 
  update: works with prototype.js v1.4, not v1.5
  update: prototype.js v1.4 breaks link_to_function used on /profile/events (and elsewhere)
- expire event show page after event past since page changes; use cronjob
- eventually remove fallback lat/lng (maybe after holiday break)
momsrising:
- a tale of 2 flickr accounts:
  * momsrising  22713890@N02 (moms.rising@yahoo.com) - revent photos going to this one
		login using:  moms.rising/manifesto
  * moms.rising 22739730@N06 Pro Account - (under address kristin@momsrising.org)

Questions for ForestEthics:
- what flickr photoset, if any, should each calendar (dec4/rolling) upload to?
	catalogcutdown flickr account: lgn/pw - fephotoupload/bigtrees
   catalogs: 72157603115827924, Sears: 72157603120227865 or create new photoset for each calendar?
	http://flickr.com/photos/70978471@N00/sets/72157603120227865/
- Molly should create a new hostform for rolling calendar from events.catalogcutdown.org/admin 
- "Take Action" links to old events system.  Remap to revent?
- "For Activist" doesn't link to revent.  Remap to revent?


- each time an attachment is uploaded, attachment_fu creates 2 additional 
  copies that are linked through parent_id (self-referential)

dia:
login/pw:  patrice@radicaldesigns.org/password

add mongrels for revent:
- edit config/mongrel_cluster.yml (change servers)
- edit 

add memory for revent:
- goto  manage.slicehost.com
- login as david@radicaldesigns.org (pw?)
- go to resize, select new size/rate
- refresh to size it prep/reboot
- check that monit restarts mysql/apache/mongrel_rails report/user/starling processors
- restart memcached
./memcached -d -m 64 -p 11211 -u nobody

using cron:
  crontab -e [-u seth]   # edit cron table
  crontab -l [-u seth]   # list cron table 

to start the report handler, start the following processes:
ruby lib/starling_control.rb start
ruby lib/report_processor_runner.rb start
ruby lib/user_processor_runner.rb start

mysql -u root -p daysofaction_production
mysql password: Dedpaift

svn quick tips:
svn diff -r HEAD [dir/file name] - diff with repository head
svn up [dir/file name] - update only dir/file name

gem uninstall rails -v 2.0.2
Time on slicehost is 8 hours ahead of PST.
find . -name \*.rb | xargs grep pattern

q's for dt:
homepage for catalogcutdown says "take part in dec4th day of action" event is past now
should show reports page

possible feature, discussion with dt and ted:
- allow admins to tag reports 
- output of list page 
- ask seth about routes tags

notes from 1/4/08 mtg with momsrising:
---
calendar for fair-pay act (launch on 8th, tuesday)
- need to give outside organizations tracking codes
- need to be able to purge other organizations members
tracking code is a field in dia supporter table
helps to find out where a user came from
tracking vs groups
revent dia doesn't allow us to put people into two groups
clear out all the events
test going on with california platform
(fair-pay) led-butter project; solid deadline
testing next week 1/7/08
report page CA
look in the logs for invite email not being sent.
long list of emails that didn't seem to work.
merge data in, send me an email that i can forward to others.
host thank you - you can copy and paste.
need better language for attachments.  narrative for why attachments could be helpful.
automatic reminder for attendees/host  
3 dia groups hosts, attendees, reporters
keep track of which hosts have sent emails to attendees
data dump out of dia
help in planning house party
have sample text for invite additional attendees


::BUG::
It appears that we're letting people create an event using an email address
that already exists in revent without authenticating.  
In EventsController#create, 
u = find_or_initialize_by_site_id_and_email(Site.current.id, params[:user][:email])
if email already exists, we let the user go ahead and create an event with this 
account without authenticating?!?


CatalogCutdown Dec 4th dia trigger keys:
report_dia

dia host trigger key
<%= hidden_field_tag "user[democracy_in_action][supporter][email_trigger_KEYS]", @hostform.dia_trigger_key %>

change current to featured
when you hit root url display events from featured calendars
if permalink is present, limit scope to that calendar

problems with this approach:
- most links have a permalink
- what happens if you go to /signup, which calendar does event get created for?
- break that route


- Move email triggers to within days of action (out of dia):
	+ add email triggers for rsvp, report
	- Make search by_zip work for Canadian postal codes
- set dec4.event_start/end = nil?
- set rolling.current = true?
- have map show both calendars events:  edit themes/catalogcutdown/views/calendars/show.rhtml
- Test using starling for downloading images
- Creating new calendar hostforms from active scaffold
- flash notice getting cached.  need to expire that shit
**
conversation with margot 12/4/07
- use different colors for past events
- push report-backs onto blog; instead of pushing report-backs to AMP
- move blogs into revent?
- FOR ACTIVISTS move to revent (let margot confirm)
- allow for setting permissions on admin side
**
done - Fix issue with flashmap
done - On admin side; hostforms not scoped by site

To generate a new theme, run:
script/generate theme name_of_theme

move email triggers from dia to revent:
---
email triggered in dia whenever event created, rsvped to
dia_trigger_id in calendar/event
email triggers
host, rsvp, report backs
set up interface to configure text for all these emails that are triggered by events.

explanation of "def by_zip"
- find lat/lng for search zip
- find all zips within 50 miles of that lat/lng
- find any event that has same zip as zips within 50 miles


remind host to enter reports for event:
once a day grab all recently finished events
and send email to host only do it for certain sites

searching by province

enforce geocodable for canadian events
need to find lat/long
throw error that this address is not mappable
enforce that postal code is real
zoomspecs from catalogcutdown

on signup page:
  states/provinces on drop-down menu on 

@calendar.events.find(:all, :conditiosn)

events = @calendar.events.find(:all, :conditions => ["end < ? AND (emailed_host IS NOT NULL AND emailed_host = true",Time.now])
events.select{|e| e.end is today}

each site has its own cache version # that gets appended to all keys 
then when this is incremented, it clears the cache.  add a Site::clear

flickr/S3 changes
remove buttons in report details page; replace with 'invite/attending' span 
automatic trigger to event host after event
 cron job that sends email to remind host to submit report
move email to host out of DIA and to revent
event searching (event type)
done - show events by tag (event search page; may already exist)
done - widget event calendar, sorted by date

move specific stuff to themes
report form
report details (# of events)
not hard-code flickr API id, tag, and email group key


need to add a line to /etc/hosts to add new site on local host

zip image files and all download for stepitiup organizers.
- write report image file names to log file with time-stamp of zip file
- save time-stamp of zip file in log

would like to test error reporting/validation on report create
also would like to avoid duplicate records being created
 - perhaps can address this by having button turn into spinner?
 - seth purposed validate_uniqueness_of :url, :scope => :report_id
but report form has problems: 
 - ajax add more photos, videos, links weird on render after errors



rsvps is a join table for events <> users or events <> politicians
make sure politician/candidate dup records have same attending/proxy setting

2 problems with listing politicians attending an event.
perhaps we should also show whose endorsing
done - hillary shows up even though she's not attending/ only endorsing
done - candidates that are rep/sen show up twice!!
done - create a self-referential key to link duplicate candidates/politician records

cleanup:
========
rsvps: use polymorphic relationship for users, delete user_id
app/views/events/total.rhtml - events not scoped by site/calendar


***
democracy_in_action_object 
- maps DIA records to local models

table = DIA table: events, campaigns, recipients, supporters
key = DIA key
synced_type = model object in revent; i.e. Event
synced_id = model object 
associated_type = 
associated_id = campaign id

***
admin features:
- add/edit politician info
- confirm/unconfirm that a politician will be attending an event
- invite a politician
- see invites for politicians

obj.build_
politician.rsvps.build
r = politician.rsvps.build
r.save
attending type, id => politician, politician.id

scp call_script.txt root@slicehost.radicaldesigns.org:/var/www/daysofaction/current
rake db:migrate ENV=production

allow hosts to edit invitation scripts:
- get rid of &mdash
- how to get signature in letter
- how to deal with emails being sent from DIA
	need to update DemocracyInActionCampaign.SuggestedText
	- when host updates invitation scripts
		can't do it here b/c we don't know which politician
	- when user invites a politician to an event
		not sure if script has been updated by host since last time
*****

-------
Run changes by Seth:
- copied themes/views/account from stepitup to stepitup2
- issues with partial rendering

- event hosts are currently stored in DIA; store in revent
- account/events views overwritten in stepitup themes
- understand how current_user works
- current_user stored in session.  Is currently DIA_Supporter Object? Yes.
- Is Account/EventsController::authorized? overwriting SysAuth::authorized? in 
- Use email as login? Yes.
- User created in EventsController::create
- site.use_democracy_in_action_auth? 

Notes:
- admin interface in themes, could move all that over into new themes
- lots of DIA dependencies that should be stored locally, need 
bridge that syncs information with DIA

Outstanding issues holding up release:
- Search by zip not working
- Removed line in rsvp.html that refs @event.service_foreign_key
- Have flashmap look up real data; no longer point to s3.amazon?
- Should we work on the zheng machine? Maybe I should create a mirror of what is on zheng?
- Links to old site (stepitup2007.org) on :permalink/events/show/:id; should point internal
- Search state map not working
- Still can't login on stepitup even after creating login/password from console; Is this DIA issue?
- Disable 'invite politician' for this release
- Does admin interface need to work for this round?

Spec-ing out invite elected-officials functionality:
David knows the specs, emails have tid-bits
List of politicians 
assume that there is a list of politicians
focus on i want to invite "blank"
end goal: list of event, # of invitations
who's turning up the heat
looking at an event: link to "invite official"
fill out what, click what 
invitations table/model

re-routed /events and :permalink to calendars/show
calendars/show: shows map
whoops! accidentally deleted _flashmap.rhtml partial
pulled it off of trac and added it back to svn
redirect_to: sends you to another page but continue executing

Need to add tests to check routes and scope.
routes:
* check that calendar permalinks work
scope:
* add new event to nwnw; doesn't show on stepitup
  - create event on nwnw
  - confirm get event from nwnw
  - confirm can't get event from stepitup
* add new calendar with permalink to nwnw
* test crud functionality for events
* nested routes (in Agile book)

From Ruby console:
done - add records to roles (admin, host, user)
done - add records to user
done - added roles to user
done - added password for user:
  u = User.find_by_name("patrice")
  u.roles << Roles.find(:first)

GET		/calendars/1;edit		edit
DELETE	/calendars/1			destroy

Code Changes:
done - added Admin::BaseController, Admin::CalendarController
  Rails automatically does namespace routing (no need to edit routes.rb)
done - moved new, create, edit, update, destroy from CalendarController to Admin::CalendarController 
done - restricted access to /admin area
  authorized? method called by required_login in authenticated_system.rb 
  overrode authorized? in Admin::BaseController; copied from reports_controller

admin controller:
create base_controller.rb
create calendar_controller.rb
	put create/edit/destroy in here
use acl system2 -> roles -> admin role
/admin/x
/admin/calendars
/admin/settings

only accessible if you are administrator
gives you list of all calendar, all events
able to edit calendar/event data

stepitup asking for new feature.	

how to become an admin, host, user
login not required for creating/hosting an event?
login required for creating a site?


how to set active calendar?
checkout why permalinks doesn't work?

done - fix destroy so that it uses :method => :delete
done - seeing some bleed between stepitup and nwnw calendars?
done - add permalink field for new/edit templates
done - make permalink unique across sites (not across whole daysofaction db)

set current site globally, options:
Site class variable @@current
global variable $CURRENT_SITE

or use around_filter to wrap with_scope around it
around_filter :scope_by_site
	def scope_by_site
		Calendar.with_scope :find => {:conditions => ["site_id = ?", @site.id]} do
		yield
	end
end

@site.calendars.find

new route

symbols in routes show up as params[:id]

Q: How did he have different themes show up for nwnw.local_daysofaction.org and stepitup.local_daysofaction.org?
A: Edited file /etc/hosts so that both URLs map to 127.0.0.1.  
Q: What is account folder about in each MVC folder?
A: 
Q: What about themes?
A: Loaded in applications.rb

http://nwnw.local_daysofaction.org/calendar

Site=Account
Account=User
Calendar=DayOfAction

Rename Accounts to UsersController
Rename Sites to AccountsController
how do you rename in SVN?

step 1
account key
contact info (admin stuff, email/pw)

step 2
add calendar
url/date defaults

Create a few events
Poke around on different sites:
  nwnw.local_daysofaction.org
  stepitup.local_daysofaction.org

modified /etc/hosts to have both URLs above point to local host (127.0.0.1)
Create a calendar (will run into issues due to Calendar(1))

index method on site controller
change home map to controller => site
welcome page, create new calendar
if there are sites or calendar, show info, else invite to create event
namespace problem with site_controller
site => determined from URL
come up with generic URL/name to set up new Site (i.e. Account)
branding for this whole thing

Changing site_controller; moved code to hacks.rb 
	(StepItUp specific; one-time thing)
Create index




- remove login as attribute of user (drop from schema)
- not required as attribute
